                    I'm 23, I'm New York City based and raised,
                     and working on becoming a Full Stack Engineer in the
                      <strong>Path2Tech</strong>
                      Program. Hoping to do more backend though.

            <h3>2 Truths and a Lie</h3>
            <p>
                Option 1: My favorite animal is the honey badger.
             </p>
                    <!--While they're definitely in the Top 5, they're not 
            quite my favorite, that spot goes to panthers which
             I like to pretend are really big house cats.-->        
            <p>

             Option 2: When I was younger I thought that if I broke my 
                    TV while watching a certain show the characters would
                    come out.
            </p>        <!--I watched a lot of cartoons so I was extra worried 
                    about breaking the TV ever because it seemed really feasible
                    for some reason.-->
            <p>
                Option 3: I've performed at a concert venue.
            </p>   
            <!--I had a music class in elementary school, and I remember us taking
                    a trip to this place called Carnegie Hall once we got a hang
                    of like 3 songs on the recorder. It was a big deal apparently.-->
